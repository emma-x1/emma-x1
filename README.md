- Hi, I'm Emma Xing. I'm a student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science.
- I'm interested in ML and AI development - both the foundational knowledge and its applications. I also like to think about CS applications in biochemistry, health, and robotics. I've worked in data science, full stack development, and machine learning software engineering.
- I'm passionate about building community and empowering girls in tech - I've hosted hackathons in Toronto and Chicago in support of this mission. I've won at Hack the Valley and Technova, and I've organized Hack404 and Hack the North!
